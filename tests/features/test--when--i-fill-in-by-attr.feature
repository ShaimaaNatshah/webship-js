Feature: An example of filling the input textbox with value by its attribute
As a tester
I want to be able to fill input text with value by its attribute

  Scenario: Check fill in input field with ID and class attribute
    Given I am on "/test--when--i-fill-in.html"
      When I fill in "uname" with "John Smith" by attr
      And I fill in "pwordcss" with "1234" by attr
      When I press "Login"
      Then I should see "You enter Username: John Smith and Password: 1234"

  Scenario: Check fill in input field with value and placeholder attribute
    Given I am on "/test--when--i-fill-in.html"
      When I fill in "Your full name" with "John Smith" by its "placeholder" attr
      And I fill in "Your Password" with "1234" by attr
      When I press "Login"
      Then I should see "You enter Username: John Smith and Password: 1234"
